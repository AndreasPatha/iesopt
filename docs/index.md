It is developed and maintained at the Center for Energy at AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH. The framework is designed to support the optimization of energy systems that are characterized by a high degree of integration between different energy carriers and sectors. It focuses on offering a modular and adaptable tool for modelers, that does not compromise on performance, while still being user-friendly. This is enabled by reducing energy system assets to abstract building blocks, that are supported by specialized implementation, and can be combined into complex systems without the need of a detailed understanding of mathematical modeling or proficiency in any coding-language.
